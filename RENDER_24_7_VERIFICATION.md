# Render 24/7 Operation Verification

## ✅ YES - Render Runs Independently!

**Render is a cloud platform** - your service runs on Render's servers 24/7, completely independent of your laptop being on or off.

## Why It Might Not Have Run at 2am EST

If the scheduled analysis didn't run, the most likely causes are:

### 1. **Service Crashed or Stopped**
- Check Render Dashboard → Logs for errors
- Look for crash messages or exceptions
- Service might have exited due to an error

### 2. **Service Was Paused/Stopped**
- Check Render Dashboard → Service Status
- Ensure service shows "Live" (green)
- If it shows "Stopped" or "Paused", manually start it

### 3. **Recent Deployment Issue**
- If you recently pushed code, the service might have restarted
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Service might be in a failed state

### 4. **Google Drive Authentication Error**
- The recent `client_secrets.json` error might have caused the service to crash
- Check logs around 2am EST for authentication errors
- The fix we just deployed should resolve this

## How to Verify It's Running 24/7

### Step 1: Check Service Status
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your `trade-alerts` service
3. Check the status indicator:
   - ✅ **Green "Live"** = Running correctly
   - ⚠️ **Yellow "Stopped"** = Not running (needs manual start)
   - ❌ **Red "Failed"** = Crashed (check logs)

### Step 2: Check Recent Logs
1. In Render Dashboard → Click "Logs" tab
2. Look for:
   - Status check messages every 10 minutes
   - Scheduled analysis messages
   - Any error messages
3. Check logs around 2am EST (7am UTC) to see what happened

### Step 3: Verify Continuous Loop
Your code has a `while True:` loop that:
- Checks every 60 seconds (`CHECK_INTERVAL`)
- Logs status every 10 minutes
- Runs analysis at scheduled times
- Monitors entry points continuously

If you see "Status Check" messages in logs, the loop is running.

## How to Ensure It Stays Running

### 1. **Auto-Restart on Crash**
Render automatically restarts services that crash, but:
- If it crashes repeatedly, Render may pause it
- Check logs to fix the root cause

### 2. **Keep Service Running**
- Don't manually stop the service unless needed
- If you stop it, remember to start it again
- Render free tier may pause services after inactivity (but worker services usually stay running)

### 3. **Monitor Logs Regularly**
- Check logs daily to catch issues early
- Look for error patterns
- Set up alerts if possible (Render Pro feature)

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If Service Shows "Stopped":
1. Click "Manual Deploy" or "Restart" button
2. Wait for service to start
3. Check logs to confirm it's running

### If Service Shows "Failed":
1. Check logs for the error
2. Fix the issue in code
3. Push fix to GitHub (auto-deploys)
4. Or manually redeploy

### If No Logs Around 2am EST:
1. Service likely crashed before 2am
2. Check logs for the last successful status check
3. Look for errors that might have caused the crash
4. The Google Drive authentication error we just fixed might have been the cause

## Expected Behavior

When running correctly, you should see in logs:
- Status checks every 10 minutes
- "Next analysis at: 02:00 EST" messages
- "=== Scheduled Analysis Time: 02:00 ===" at 2am EST
- "Starting full analysis workflow..." messages
- Analysis completion messages

## Current Status Check

After the recent fix for Google Drive authentication:
1. Service should auto-redeploy (1-2 minutes)
2. Check logs to confirm it's running
3. Wait for next scheduled time to verify it runs
4. Monitor logs around 2am EST tomorrow to confirm

## Summary

✅ **Render runs 24/7 independently** - your laptop doesn't need to be on
✅ **Code has continuous loop** - it should keep running
⚠️ **Service might have crashed** - check logs to see why
✅ **Recent fix deployed** - should resolve authentication issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Check Render Dashboard → Service Status
2. Review logs around 2am EST to see what happened
3. Verify service is "Live" and running
4. Monitor next scheduled analysis time
