## Troubleshooting

### If you see errors:

1. **Check logs:**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Check which step failed

2. **Verify API keys:**
   - Render Dashboard → Environment
   - Ensure all API keys are set

3. **Check Google Drive:**
   - Verify folder ID is correct
   - Ensure files are in the folder

4. **Verify email settings:**
   - Check SMTP credentials
   - Verify recipient email

## Notes

- Manual tests don't affect scheduled analyses
- Scheduled analyses will still run at their set times
- Each test triggers a full analysis cycle
- You'll receive an email for each test run
